This bot increase your Instagram followers easy and fast.

Installing on Linux:
1. "git clone https://github.com/SenoxCode/insbot.py"
2. "cd insbot.py"
3. "pip install -r requirements.txt
4. "chmod +x insbot.py"
5. "xdg-open insbot.py"

You're finished now. Now there will come some errors at the begin of the line, but don't matter, it will still work. I am trying to fix this in the next version.
